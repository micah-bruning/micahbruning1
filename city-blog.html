                <h5>May 22, 2020</h5>
                <p> I’ve been back from school for too long now and the claustrophobic feeling of being stuck in my frontage-road house is becoming too strong. I take walks in the evening, and sometimes mid-day, to escape the confines of my bedroom walls. While my house is right by the I-10 frontage road, I’ve found some enjoyable streets to walk along that are lined with aesthetically pleasing houses and pretty impressive tree coverage.

                    For some context, San Antonio suburbs (I say “suburb” even though there’s no real urban center) are like a lot of Southwest American cities: cut through by freeways, packed full of dull housing developments and strip malls. Aside from a few shopping complexes, there really is no place to congregate for the sole purpose of being in that place. Even if there was such a place, there’s no chance it would be reachable by foot. The closest thing you can get are the nature trails dispersed through the city, but they more or less all look the same--save a few special spots--and you definitely need a car to reach those.

                    Walking through the nearby neighborhoods I’ve stumbled upon a few noteworthy suburban greenways. Greenways are the best because they’re the one part of the landscape that’s not being used for a designated purpose other than buffer space. Sure, some of them are dedicated to gigantic powerline towers or irrigation systems, but I’ve seen some lately that are nearly untouched.

                    Today, I walked with my dog to a neighborhood adjacent to mine up a busy street of cars. I like going up to this neighborhood because there are small, beautifully designed houses that have yards abounding with trees and plants. “Abounding” is an overstatement, but the yards near me either have ample plant life or overly-manicured, boring grass lawns. 
                    After hopping over a barrier that closes off the street to cars crossing into an adjacent neighborhood, I noticed a small little embankment off to the side of the street. I saw a dry creek (or sewage) bed at the bottom of the embankment and was drawn down there. I took my dog down the tree-heavy embankment to reach the creek bed to discover my new favorite part of San Antonio. The tree coverage of the creek bed provides near total shade, and the opposite side of the bed also slopes upward giving the “stone”-way a valley like feeling.

                    <br>
                    I walked along the creek bed in the same direction I was going through the neighborhood. 
                    Pockets of still, green water started popping up until I reached the full creek. I kept walking along the side, still at the bottom of the two embankments. Trash was everywhere. It’s fairly common to see trash scattered throughout a city’s greenways, but this was a new level. The furthest point down the creek I went had bags and bags of worn out clothes and junk. People were clearly dumping their shit down there when their trash bins got too full. I always feel a bit sad when I see my favorite suburban niches littered with junk, but after seeing these piles of garbage in my new favorite spot I wanted to take some action. What if I formed a group of people to clean up the greenways I love? I quickly realized this would ruin the sanctity of these places. I’d be directly exposing these hidden spots to more people and maybe one day the city would create a lame hiking trail near the creek (in fact, this happened with one of my old favorite greenways near my old house). Trash is a paradox. It simultaneously conveys that dozens of people have been to a specific spot and that nobody has really been to that place because there’s no care shown for it. In cities where every corner is overdeveloped and has a specific use, trash, in the context of a greenway, signals that a place is still untouched and undesignated.  </p>

                <p>"Topophilia" is a word to describe a strong sense of place. I use this blog to 
                    write about places and ideas related to the natural and built enviroment. I'm planning to incorporate some 
                    data visualizations and pictures, as well as giving this page some cosmetic enhancements.
